*To run, drag the .html file into a web browser*

Enter the names in the field at the top and have them either randomly or entered in order into the bracket. Clicking a name advances that team to the next stage, coloring them green, and colors the other red. 

This program includes implementations of 8, 16, 32, and 64 team brackets that the user can switch between. The brackets can be switched between without losing data, since the switching mechanism is just a live update of the stylesheet which hides the visibility of all elements except the ones in the selected bracket.
